CORE MODES
• Default Mode (Relative/Vector): Match the internal shape and proportions. White Dot(left side) anchors the shape, ignoring overall positional errors.
• Absolute Position Mode: Match the exact absolute location and shape (translated or mirrored) onto the right side.

CHALLENGE MODES
• Mirror Mode: Requires you to create a horizontal reflection (a mirror image) of the Target Shape across the center line.
• Memory Mode: The Target Shape on the left disappears after 2 seconds, forcing you to reproduce the pattern based purely on visual memory. The Copy Area is masked for the first 3 seconds to enforce memorization.

Press 'Next Pattern' to apply mode changes.
